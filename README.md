Pylor is an API helper library for [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/). It lets you create and manage REST API routes with a simpler wrapper on top of Express, and adds a powerful permission system and support for dogfooding your endpoints.

Pylor has no dependencies, apart from the implicit dependency on Express, and works equally well in both Node.js and the browser.

Pylor was initially developed for internal use at [ITSI](https://www.it.si).
